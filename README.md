This package is a collection of my favorite functions around bayesian analysis from various packages. It is  designed around my personal workflow for data analysis and documents my methodology.  Please Note:  I don't have formal masters degree training around Bayesian statistics, but only strive to be a lifelong learner through reading, workshops, and online classes.

My approach is heavily focused on making informed probabilistic decisions, as a business practitioner.  Much of my training, like most others, was based in classical statistics.  I have since moved away from p-value driven hypothesis testing and taking on a decision making model framework that addresses risk and probabilistic outcomes.

The center of my analysis and decision framework includes: 

 + Bayes Factors
 + Empirical Bayesian Methods
 + Beta Regression
 + Mixed Model Regression
 + Probability Trees
 + Monte Carlo Simulation
